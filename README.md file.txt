Final Reflection – Sprint Review & Retrospective
1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Interpreting user needs begins with understanding the problem from the user's perspective. User stories help break down requirements into specific, actionable items that keep the focus on the user’s goals. They allow developers to align the software design with real-world use cases and ensure the product remains user-centered.

2. How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I approach development by starting with planning and breaking tasks into sprints. Agile processes like daily standups, iterative development, and sprint retrospectives help me stay organized and flexible. I especially value continuous feedback and frequent testing, which Agile encourages.

3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member means being reliable, communicative, and open to feedback. It also involves actively contributing during planning, respecting deadlines, and helping teammates when challenges arise. Collaboration and a shared commitment to team goals are key to success.
